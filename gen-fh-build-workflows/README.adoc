= gen-fh-build-workflows

This is an internal tool we use to generate the build workflows
for github so we don't have to do it manually and get it wrong.

It uses two mustache templates and reads the package.json files for each
project listed and depending on what steps are available, it generates those
steps into the mustache templates.
